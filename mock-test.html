                        <h3>Passage 1: The History of Tea</h3>
                        
                        <p>Tea is one of the world's oldest and most popular beverages, with origins tracing back to ancient China more than 5,000 years ago. According to legend, tea was discovered in 2737 BCE by the Chinese Emperor Shen Nong, who was boiling water when leaves from a nearby tea tree blew into his pot. The emperor was intrigued by the pleasant aroma and decided to taste the infusion, thus discovering tea's refreshing properties.</p>

                        <p>By the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), tea had become China's national beverage and was considered essential to daily life. It was during this period that Lu Yu wrote the first definitive book on tea, "The Classic of Tea," which detailed cultivation methods, brewing techniques, and the cultural significance of tea in Chinese society. The Tang Dynasty also saw the development of tea as an item of trade, transported along the Silk Road to Tibet, the Middle East, and eventually to other parts of the world.</p>

                        <p>Tea arrived in Japan around the 6th century, brought by Buddhist monks who had traveled to China to study. The Japanese embraced tea culture enthusiastically, developing their own unique traditions, including the elaborate Japanese tea ceremony (chanoyu), which was perfected in the 16th century by the tea master Sen no Rikyū. The ceremony emphasizes spiritual and aesthetic principles, viewing tea preparation as a meditative practice embodying harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility.</p>

                        <p>Europeans first encountered tea in the 16th century, with Portuguese merchants and missionaries bringing back accounts of the exotic beverage from their travels in the East. However, it wasn't until the 17th century that tea became popular in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands and England. The Dutch East India Company began importing tea to Europe in 1610, but it remained a luxury item due to its high cost, consumed primarily by the aristocracy and the wealthy merchant class.</p>

                        <p>Tea's journey to England is closely tied to Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese princess who married King Charles II in 1662. Catherine was an avid tea drinker and introduced the beverage to the English court, making it fashionable among the nobility. By the 18th century, tea had become increasingly accessible to the middle classes, and tea houses began to spring up across London, serving as social hubs where people gathered to drink tea, exchange news, and conduct business.</p>

                        <p>The British East India Company, which had obtained a monopoly on tea imports to Britain, played a crucial role in expanding the tea trade. As demand for tea grew in Britain, the Company began to cultivate tea in India to reduce reliance on Chinese imports. The discovery that tea plants were native to Assam in India led to the establishment of tea plantations throughout the region in the 1830s. Later, tea cultivation expanded to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and parts of Africa, diversifying production beyond China.</p>

                        <p>The high taxes imposed on tea by the British government led to a thriving smuggling trade in the 18th century and played a role in the American Revolution. The infamous Boston Tea Party of 1773, in which American colonists dumped British tea into Boston Harbor to protest taxation without representation, was a pivotal event leading to American independence. Following these events, coffee temporarily surpassed tea as the preferred beverage in America.</p>

                        <p>Today, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world after water, with thousands of varieties available. Its global journey from a medicinal herb in ancient China to a staple beverage across cultures demonstrates tea's remarkable adaptability and enduring appeal. Each region has developed its own traditions around tea preparation and consumption, reflecting local tastes, customs, and values. Whether served hot or cold, plain or sweetened, in elaborate ceremonies or from disposable cups, tea continues to bring people together in a shared experience that transcends cultural boundaries.</p>
